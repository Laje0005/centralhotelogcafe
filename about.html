                <p>
                    The story behind the one small room at Central Hotel and Coffee is both fascinating and unique.
                    Originally, the building
                    served as a shoemaker's shop in the early 20th century. Over time, the need for the shoemaker's
                    services diminished, and
                    the building was repurposed for various uses.The small size and location of the building made it
                    perfect for an
                    intimate and cozy hotel project.
                    <br>
                    <br>In 2013, the current owner - Leif Thingtved skælmsk decided to convert the top floor of the
                    building into a hotel room while retaining the ground floor as a cozy café. The idea was to create a
                    unique and exclusive
                    accommodation offering a personalized and memorable experience in the heart of Copenhagen. Since
                    then, the hotel has
                    attracted guests from around
                    the world seeking a different and charming stay.
                    <br>
                    <br>This one room has become a symbol of the boutique hotel concept, where quality and personalized
                    service are highly
                    valued. It's a small gem in Copenhagen where history, design, and hospitality blend together to
                    create an unforgettable
                    experience.

                <p>
                    In the café at Central Hotel, the decor is part of the experience. Every detail is carefully
                    selected to create an atmosphere of homely comfort and aesthetic appeal. You will notice the soft,
                    cushioned chairs and sofas where you can sink down and relax while enjoying your coffee.
                    The colors and materials have been chosen with care to create a warm and inviting atmosphere where
                    guests immediately feel welcome.
                    The lighting is soft and subdued, and the beautifully arranged plants add a touch of nature and
                    life to the room.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Everywhere you can find small, unique details that give the cafe its own personality and charm, from
                    artwork on the walls to vintage accessories on the shelves. Whether you sit by the window and watch
                    the life of
                    the city or find a cozy corner in the café's deep sofas, you will discover that this small café is
                    more than just a
                    place to have a cup of coffee.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    It is a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, where you can relax, find
                    inspiration, and enjoy the simple joys of the moment.
